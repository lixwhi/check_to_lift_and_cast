# check_to_lift_and_cast
checks the current number of votes. When there are enough votes it calls lift on the chief contract and cast on the slate

you will need to change/add some lines to get this to work for future slates

I've put in comments describing each alteration in the file. Here is a summary:

line 6 - change to your web3 provider

line 12/13 - put in your address/key
